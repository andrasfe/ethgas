# Using probabilistic forecasting for Gas Price Prediction in Ethereum Blockchain


Probabilistic forecasting, i.e. estimating the probability distribution of a time seriesâ€™ future given its past

## Collection of data:

1. Run notebook `ethereum-blockchain-data.ipynb` to prepare training/test/validation samples by fetching from BigData

2. Launch notebook `deepar_eth_gas.ipynb` to train and ouput test data/reports with data generated at point 1
